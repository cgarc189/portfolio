  <h2>Learning About Autism</h2>
  <p>
    Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a condition that affects how people communicate, interact, and experience the world. Each person with autism is unique, with their own strengths, challenges, and ways of seeing life. Understanding autism can help us be more patient, supportive, and inclusive in our communities.

    If you want to learn more about autism and how to support those on the spectrum, check out <a href="https://www.autism-society.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Autism Society</a>. They provide helpful resources, guides, and tips for families, friends, and educators.

        <h2>Crisis Text Line</h2>
        <p>If talking feels too hard, you can text instead.
Just text HOME to 741741 and chat with a trained volunteer.
They can help you calm down, breathe, and figure out your next steps.
Sometimes typing your thoughts feels easier than saying them out loud.</p>
